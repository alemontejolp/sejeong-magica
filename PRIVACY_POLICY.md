# Privacy Policy: SeJeong Magica

SeJeong Magica is a free application that privides a chat simulator for
yes/no/maybe questions. It answers with the respective word and an
ilustrative image. These answers are randomly retrieved from the website
https://yesno.wtf, so internet access is requested, and then presented
to the user. As the answers are random, they does not depend on the user input.
The only usage of the input is to detect a question mark, which is a process
performed in the user device.


Our application does nothing more than add
WhatsApp sticker packs to your local installation of said application, as
described in the [advanced development section](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers/tree/master/Android#advanced-development),
in the WhatsApp's repository called "stickers" (Android version).


So we do not collect or share any personally identifiable information,
or other kind of information.
