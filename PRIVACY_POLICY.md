# Privacy Policy: SeJeong Magica

SeJeong Magica is a free application that provides a chat simulator for
yes/no/maybe questions that the user has to enter. The application answers with the
respective word and an ilustrative image. These answers are randomly
retrieved from the website https://yesno.wtf, and then presented to the
user. For this purpuse the application requests Internet access.

As the answers are random generated, they does not depend on the user input.
That means no data leaves the user device to be processed. The only usage for
the input text is to detect a question mark, which if found triggers the
request of a random answer. This detection the is the only processing of the
text entered by the user and is performed locally.

The user input is kept in memory while the application is running. Once the
application is closed, the text entered by the user is lost. No data is saved at all.
So we do not collect or share any personally identifiable information,
or other kind of information.
